      Our Problem
    </h3>
  
    <p class="text-content" style="margin-bottom:0px;">
      Unlike other open-source software, Dingo was started out as a personal project of its author, a non-designer non-artist programmer. Therefore, all the icons that are distributed with the currently latest release of Dingo (except for the main logo, which was designed by <a href="http://www.customicondesign.com/" target="_blank" class="doc-link">Custom Icon Design</a>) are taken from either <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/" target="_blank" class="doc-link">GNOME 3</a> or other free software packages. <strong>This is really not a good thing and so we need help from volunteer designers and artists</strong>.

      The full list of icons is available through <a href="https://github.com/phongvcao/dingo/tree/master/data/icons" target="_blank" class="doc-link">our Github repository</a>. You can also <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/download/development/" class="doc-link">download the latest development version of Dingo</a> to see these icons. All of the icons are in need to be redesigned or replaced with something better-looking and unique to Dingo.

      Design Guidelines

      Please keep in mind that Dingo uses the <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" class="doc-link">Gtkmm</a> <a href="http://www.gtk.org/" target="_blank" class="doc-link">(GTK+)</a> library for its user-interface. This means that Dingo's icons should be designed in a way that fit with the GNOME icons theme. Please read <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.5/icons-design.html.en" target="_blank" class="doc-link">Designing Effective Icons</a> and <a href="http://art.gnome.org/" target="_blank" class="doc-link">art.gnome.org</a> before getting started.
